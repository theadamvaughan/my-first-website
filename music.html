      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>Another interest of mine is music and DJing. Prior to learning how to become a software engineer, I hosted a weekly radio show on <a href="http:www.codesouth.fm" target="_blank">www.codesouth.fm</a> called "The Weekend Has Landed", which I did for about 4 years. The shows name was inspired by a speech in the 1999 film, <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/Movie'></span><span itemprop="name">"Human Traffic"</span>, and that it was every Friday from 6 to 8pm which is about the time people finish their working week.</p>
      <p>I was also lucky enough to be a resident at the Honey Club in Brighton. During my 2 years there I warmed up for various stars such as <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/person'></span><span itemprop="name">Judge Jules</span>, <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/person'></span><span itemprop="name">Danny Howard</span>, <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/person'></span><span itemprop="name">Chuckie</span> and
        <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/person'></span><span itemprop="name">Norman Jay MBE</span>.</p>
      <p>In 2013 I did a season in Ibiza selling tickets around San Antoinio for <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/NightClub'></span><span itemprop='name'>Ushuaia</span>. Ushuaia is an open-air club based in Playa Den Bossa and has regularly been placed amongst the best nightclubs in the world. During my time on the white isle I played at various bars, but the main highlight was playing at <span itemscope itemtype= 'http://schema.org/NightClub'></span><span itemprop='name'>Eden</span>.</p>
      <p>I have selected s few shows and mixes from my mixcloud page below. If you want to hear more, head over to <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/TheWeekendHasLandedOfficial" target="_blank" itemprop="url">www.mixcloud.com/TheWeekendHasLandedOfficial</a></p>
