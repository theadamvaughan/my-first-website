    <h2>What's all this racket?</h2>
<p>Another interest of mine is music and DJing. Prior to learning how to become a software engineer, I hosted a weekly radio show on www.codesouth.fm called "The Weekend Has Landed", which I did for about 4 years. The shows name was inspired by a speech in the 1999 film, "Human Traffic", and that it was every Friday from 6 to 8pm which is about the time people finish their working week.</p>
<p>I was also lucky enough to be a resident at the Honey Club in Brighton. During my 2 years there I warmed up for various stars such as Judge Jules, Danny Howard, Chuckie and Norman Jay MBE.</p>
<p>In 2013 I did a season in Ibiza selling tickets around San Antoinio for Ushuaia. Ushuaia is an open-air club based in Playa Den Bossa and has regularly been placed amongst the best nightclubs in the world. During my time on the white isle I played at various bars, but the main highlight was playing at Eden.</p>
<p>I have selected s few shows and mixes from my mixcloud page below. If you want to hear more, head over to www.mixcloud.com/TheWeekendHasLandedOfficial</p>
