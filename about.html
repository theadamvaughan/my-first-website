<h2>About Adam Vaughan</h2>
<p>Born into a family of gypsies, Adam was forced to join a travelling circus at the tender age of 5 where he worked as a lion tamer. But at age 7, Adam was viciously mauled by a pack of monkeys when he accidently stepped into the monkey cage with a pocket full of ripe bananas</p>
<p>After extensive surgery and 6 million dollars later, Adam was back on his feet. However, the attack left him mentally scarred and Adam was forced to quit the job he loved so much, and went to work with the Navy, where he worked scrubbing the decks, and painting over the rust which had surfaced due to the years of erosion caused by the salty sea air.</p>
<p>The years of hard scrubbing and painting soon paid off when he was promoted to Admiral of the fleet in the summer of 1993 and soon became the most decorated officer in Naval history. However, the constant years at sea took it's toll and Adam suffered horrible bouts of Sea Sickness and was discharged by the Queen from his Naval duties in the winter of 1997.</p>
<p>This unfortunate turn of events plunged Adam into a life of crime and he soon found himself dealing drugs to the rich and famous. At one time, Adam's 'clients' included Daniella Westbrook, Pete Doherty and The Pope.</p>
<p>After buying lots of booze, fast cars and hookers, Adam squandered the rest and soon found himself stealing to fund his own addiction, an addiction to stealing.</p>
<p>Adam was finally caught in 2002 when he was trying to steal an armchair from an old folks home which still had Mrs Ethel McGuiness sitting in it at the time. He was later sentenced to 720 hours community service, which was cut down to 3 hours 42 minutes for good behaviour.</p>
<p>After a lengthy spell at the Priory, and help from his celebrity friends who he met there, Adam finally sorted himself out. He now has a steady job working in Brighton, in a small office packed with dwarfs, midgets and a giraffe named colin where he talks on the phone a lot and dodges making the coffees.</p>
<p>His hair and eyebrows are currently insured for Â£20,000 and he owns 6 pairs of shoes - FACT!</p>
