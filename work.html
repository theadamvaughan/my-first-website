            <p>The website where all of this started!</p>
            <p>As per my about page, this website has taken on various forms throughout my coding journey.</p>
            <p>One of the major revamps it has was after I realised I was creating pages for the sake of creating pages.</p>
            <p>After a long think about how I wanted the site to look I took it all down and replaced it with a holding page, after all, I had paid for the domain so might as well have something there, right?</p>
            <p>If you look hard enough, you’ll find an easter egg that will take you to the holding page I created. What score can you get?<p>
            <p>To get a full understanding of all the different look and feels the site has, head over to <a href="http://github.com/theadamvaughan/my-first-website" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a> and view all the commits made.<p>

            <p>A friend of mine was looking for a website to promote his carpet business.</p>
            <p>After understanding what specifications he wanted for his site, I realised that providing him with a website that suited his needs was slightly beyond my skill level at that point.</p>
            <p>I had purchased my web address at this point and the free hosting service I used had the option of using work press so I thought I would give it a go.</p>
            <p>I didn’t find the sites wordpress plugin very user friendly and moved over to <a href="https://www.wix.com" target="_blank" itemprop="url">wix.com</a>.</p>
            <p>Over the course of a weekend I was able to design his website that he was happy with. We had to sit down and go through the small detail and a bit of user acceptance testing to ensure everything worked.</p>
            <p>So, if you’re based near Brighton and need a new carpet, laminate floor or artificial grass, why not head over to <a href="https://www.day2dayflooring.co.uk" target="_blank" itemprop="url">www.day2dayflooring.co.uk.</a></p>

            <p>Ok, so I didn’t build this site or the app but I did find it useful.</p>
            <p>Mimo is an app that teaches app-making, website-building, hacking, and more in a fun and interactive way on the go</p>
            <p>I found it great and easy to use. The bite size lessons are don’t take long to complete and I could do it on my commute to and from work.</p>
            <p>It is a subscription service, but for the £45 odd I paid for the year, it’s a small price to pay to help me with my coding journey.<p>
